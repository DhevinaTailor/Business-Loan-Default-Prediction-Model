# DefaultShield: Business Loan Default Prediction Model 🛡️

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Business Loan Default Prediction Model project! This README file provides a detailed project overview, including the problem area, stakeholders affected, the proposed data science solution, and a granular description of the dataset.

### Problem Area 🚀

#### Problem Statement

Business loan defaults pose a significant challenge for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. The problem is two-fold: it leads to substantial financial losses for these institutions and affects small and medium-sized businesses seeking loans. Predicting and preventing loan defaults is crucial for maintaining a healthy financial ecosystem.

#### Stakeholders Affected 🌍

- **Financial Institutions:** Banks and credit unions that provide business loans.
- **Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs):** Organizations seeking loans to support growth and operations.

### Proposed Data Science Solution 🧠

In this project, we propose building a predictive model to identify potential business loan defaults using historical data. The solution involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection 📊:** Gather historical loan application data, including information about applicants, loan terms, repayment history, and loan status.

2. **Data Preprocessing 🛠️:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈:** Gain insights into the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and visualize key information. EDA helps understand the data and informs subsequent steps.

4. **Feature Engineering 🧰:** Create new features and transform data to enhance the model's predictive power. This step aims to improve the model's performance.

5. **Model Selection 🤖:** Evaluate various machine learning algorithms (logistic regression) for predicting loan defaults.

6. **Model Training 🎓:** Train the selected model on the prepared dataset, using historical loan data.

7. **Model Evaluation 📊:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

8. **Deployment 🚀:** Deploy the trained model to provide real-time or batch predictions, supporting loan approval decisions.

### Roadmap 🗺️

Here's a roadmap outlining the project's progress and what to expect in the coming weeks:

#### Completed Tasks 🎉

1. **Problem Statement and Stakeholders:** We've defined the problem area, outlined the problem statement, and identified the stakeholders affected by business loan defaults.

2. **Proposed Data Science Solution:** The proposed solution, from data collection to EDA, is well-documented. We've also started the EDA process.

3. **Dataset Description:** The dataset, sourced from the Small Business Administration (SBA), is described in detail, including a data dictionary for all 27 columns.

4. **Initial Learnings:** We've shared key learnings up to the EDA stage, highlighting the importance of understanding the data and addressing data cleaning and feature selection.

#### Upcoming Tasks 📅

1. **EDA Completion:** We will complete the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, gaining deeper insights into the dataset and identifying patterns and relationships.

2. **Feature Engineering:** After EDA, we will proceed with feature engineering, creating new features and transforming data to enhance our model's predictive power.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** We will evaluate and select a machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) and train the model using the prepared dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model will be evaluated for performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Deployment:** The final step involves deploying the trained model to provide real-time or batch predictions, which will support loan approval decisions.

Our roadmap ensures that we are making steady progress toward our goal of building a robust business loan default prediction model. Stay tuned for updates and further insights as we move forward.

### Impact of the Solution 💼

Implementing an effective loan default prediction model can have a significant impact:

- **Financial Institutions:** Reduce financial losses by identifying high-risk loan applications early in the approval process.
- **Small and Medium-sized Businesses:** Improve the efficiency and fairness of the loan application process, making access to credit more predictable.

### Description of the SBA Dataset 📂

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Small Business Administration (SBA), a federal agency that provides support and resources to small businesses in the United States. It contains historical information related to business loans and loan applicants.

This comprehensive dataset encompasses various aspects of loan applications, including applicant details, loan terms, geographical information, and loan outcomes. The data enables us to explore and predict business loan defaults, a critical challenge for both financial institutions and small businesses.

The dataset used in this project contains various fields related to business loans. Below is a detailed data dictionary for the dataset:

### Learnings 🧐

Here are the key things we've learned in the early stages of our project:

- **Getting to Know the Data:** We've taken a close look at our dataset to understand its structure and challenges, which is essential for our analysis.

- **Data Cleanup:** We've cleaned the data, addressing missing values, and inconsistencies, ensuring that it's reliable for analysis.

- **Choosing the Right Features:** We've decided which data features are important for our analysis and future predictive model.

- **Initial Insights:** We've uncovered some initial patterns, distributions, and anomalies in the data.

- **Visualizing Data:** Visualizations, like charts and graphs, have helped us understand the data's characteristics and discover hidden trends.

- **Feature Relationships:** We've explored how different data features relate to each other and to our target variable (loan defaults).

These learnings provide the groundwork for the project. The goal is to create a robust loan default prediction model with these insights.
