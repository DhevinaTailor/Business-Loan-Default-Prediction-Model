# DefaultShield: Business Loan Default Prediction Model 🛡️

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Business Loan Default Prediction Model project! This README provides a comprehensive overview, including the problem area, stakeholders affected, our data science solution, and details of our dataset and model.

### Problem Area 🚀

#### Problem Statement

Business loan defaults significantly impact financial institutions and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Our goal is to predict and prevent loan defaults, maintaining a healthy financial ecosystem.

#### Stakeholders Affected 🌍

- **Financial Institutions:** Banks and credit unions providing business loans.
- **SMBs:** Organizations seeking loans for growth and operations.

### Proposed Data Science Solution 🧠

We built a predictive model using historical loan data. Key steps included:

1. **Data Collection 📊:** Historical loan application data.
2. **Data Preprocessing 🛠️:** Data cleaning and preparation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📈:** Insights and patterns identification.
4. **Feature Engineering 🧰:** Enhancement of the dataset.
5. **Model Selection and Training 🤖🎓:** Logistic regression and other algorithms.
6. **Model Evaluation 📊:** Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
7. **Deployment 🚀:** Providing real-time or batch predictions.

### Roadmap 🗺️
