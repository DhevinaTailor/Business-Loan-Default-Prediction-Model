    "The `df.describe()` method, which provides summary statistics, can be applied to the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term**: The 'Term' column likely represents the loan term in months, which is a numerical feature. You can use `df.describe()` to obtain statistics like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for this column. It helps us understand the distribution of loan terms and their central tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoEmp**: This column contains numerical data, representing the number of business employees. `df.describe()` is well-suited for generating statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for this column. It helps us understand the central tendency and spread of the employee count in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CreateJob** and **RetainedJob**: Both of these columns are likely related to job creation and retention. They are numerical features, and `df.describe()` can be used to derive statistics on these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following columns, `df.describe()` is not applicable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LoanNr_ChkDgt**: This column likely serves as an identifier or primary key for each loan entry. It contains unique values and is not suitable for generating meaningful numerical statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zip**: Zip codes are categorical data representing geographical locations and postal codes. `df.describe()` is not applicable to zip codes as it's designed for numerical statistics, not categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NAICS**: NAICS codes represent industry categories and classifications. These are categorical variables, and `df.describe()` is not appropriate for generating numerical statistics for this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NewExist**: This column contains categorical values (1 and 2) indicating whether a business is existing (1) or new (2). It doesn't provide meaningful numerical statistics, and using `df.describe()` on categorical data like this is not suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FranchiseCode**: Franchise codes are categorical values representing franchise status. `df.describe()` is not suitable for generating numerical statistics for this type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **UrbanRural**: This column contains categorical values (0, 1, and 2) indicating urban, rural, or undefined locations. `df.describe()` is not applicable to this type of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the applicability of `df.describe()` for specific columns is essential for utilizing this method effectively in data analysis, ensuring that it provides meaningful insights based on the nature of the data."

    "**Step 4: Drop High Missing Data Columns**\n",

    "### Interpretation of the \"MIS_Status\" Column (Target Variable):\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"MIS_Status\" column in the dataset serves as the primary target variable. It indicates the status of a loan, classifying it as either \"Charged Off\" (CHGOFF) or \"Paid in Full\" (PIF).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Charged Off (CHGOFF)**: This category signifies that the loan has been declared as \"charged off,\" typically indicating a significant delinquency or default.\n",
    "- **Paid in Full (PIF)**: This category denotes that the loan has been successfully paid off in full by the borrower.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"MIS_Status\" column is of utmost importance in understanding the loan's ultimate outcome. It allows us to categorize loans into two critical groups: those that resulted in default (\"Charged Off\") and those that were successfully repaid (\"Paid in Full\"). This information is vital for predictive modeling, enabling the assessment of factors that contribute to loan default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Timing of Variable in the Loan Application Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"MIS_Status\" variable becomes known after the loan's term has progressed, and it reflects the outcome of the borrower's ability to meet their repayment obligations. It is a post-disbursement variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision on Data Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the primary target variable for predicting loan default, the \"MIS_Status\" column is valuable. Therefore, it is recommended to **retain** this column and utilize it as the focal point for building the predictive model to assess the loan default risk.\n"

    "We removed these columns from the dataset for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LoanNr_ChkDgt**: This column contains loan numbers or identifiers, which don't really help us predict loan defaults. They're more for record-keeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ApprovalDate** and **ApprovalFY**: These columns provide information about when a loan was approved. However, this timing isn't directly relevant to predicting loan defaults, as loan approval decisions are typically made before the actual loan is granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Term**: The term of the loan, which indicates the repayment period, isn't a significant factor in predicting loan defaults. It's more related to the loan's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CreateJob** and **RetainedJob**: These columns show the number of jobs created or retained due to a loan. While this is important information for other purposes, it's not directly linked to predicting loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ChgOffDate** and **DisbursementDate** (previously dropped): These dates are associated with specific loan events, like charge-offs and disbursements, which occur after a loan has already defaulted. Including them in predictions would reveal information about the outcome, leading to data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **DisbursementGross**: This column represents the loan disbursement amount, and its relevance to predicting loan defaults may be limited or highly correlated with other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **BalanceGross**: The remaining loan balance doesn't help predict defaults, and including it could lead to data leakage if it reflects the loan's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **ChgOffPrinGr**: This is the charged-off principal amount resulting from loan defaults. Including it would introduce data leakage, as it's a consequence of the event we're trying to predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **GrAppv**: The gross amount approved might not be a strong predictor for loan defaults, or it could be highly correlated with other approved amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these columns were dropped to avoid data leakage and concentrate on the most relevant features for predicting loan defaults."
